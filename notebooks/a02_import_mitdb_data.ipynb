    "This notebook downloads the entire MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, which is publicly available here: https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/mitdb/\n",
    "\n",
    "It then converts all the WFDB files into CSV files with the same name (example from 100.dat, 100.hea, 100.atr the file 100.csv is generated).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row in the CSV file corresponds to a single heartbeat and is generated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Split MIT-BIH record at the R-peaks into individual heartbeat records.\n",
    "    Each heartbeat record is appended with the first 40 readings of the next heartbeat record so that we include a full QRS Complex.\n",
    "    Resample each heartbeat record from 360Hz to 125Hz.\n",
    "    Normalize the mV readings to a 0-1 range.\n",
    "    Heartbeat records longer than 187 values are discarded.\n",
    "    Heartbeat records are padded with zeroes at the end until they contain exactly 187 values.\n",
    "    Heartbeat classifications from the annotations is reduced to just Normal and Abnormal and appended to the end of each heartbeat record (0 is normal, 1 is abnormal). Each row then contains exactly 188 values.\n",
    "    Heartbeat records without classifications are discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of these CSV files is so that they can be used in training your ECG model for classifying heartbeats as either Normal or Abnormal."
