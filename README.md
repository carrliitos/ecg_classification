## Introduction

The aim of this project is to develop a classification model for Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals using the ECG-ID 
Database obtained from the PhysioNet Database website. This dataset contains 310 ECG recordings from 90 individuals, 
providing a rich source of information for analysis. The goal is to accurately classify ECG signals, which is crucial 
for detecting various cardiac conditions.

## Prior Works

Several studies have successfully employed machine learning techniques for ECG signal classification. In 2020, 
Darmawahyuni et al. emphasized the critical role of ECG signal classification in automatic heart abnormality diagnosis, 
highlighting the precision of artificial intelligence approaches in detecting patterns that may go unnoticed by human 
interpreters, while also pointing out the challenges in achieving rapid and accurate classification due to signal 
characteristics [1]. Additionally, in May of this year, Ramkumar et al. proposed an ensemble classifier for accurate 
arrhythmia detection using ECG signals, utilizing Residual Exemplars Local Binary Pattern for feature extraction, and 
achieving significantly higher accuracy, area under the curve, and F-Measure compared to existing models [2]. These 
studies highlight the potential of machine learning in ECG analysis and serve as valuable references for our project.

## Project Aims

### Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the raw ECG signals to remove noise and artifacts.
2. Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from both raw and filtered signals to represent ECG patterns effectively.
3. Model Selection: Evaluate various classification algorithms (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, Neural Networks) to determine 
the most suitable approach.
4. Model Training and Validation: Train the chosen model on a subset of the data and validate its performance.

## Experiments

1. Performance Evaluation: Assess the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the validation set.
2. Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune model parameters to optimize performance.
3. Cross-Validation: Conduct cross-validation to ensure robustness of the chosen approach.
4. Comparison with Prior Works: Compare the performance of our model with existing studies in ECG classification.
